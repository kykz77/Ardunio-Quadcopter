# Ardunio-Quadcopter
 Hello! Welcome to my Ardunio Quadcopter project!
 
 I am using an Ardunio Uno as a flight controller to fly a quadcopter. In this project I make use of pin change interrupts, an IMU (gyroscope and accelerometer), ESCs and a PID controller to fly the quadcopter. 

 Although I am currently experiencing some difficulty in tuning my PID controller to get the quadcopter to perfectly stabilise, the quadcopter is able to recieve and respond to RC signals, and make use of the gyroscope and accelrometer data to determine which directions it must move in to stabilise itself during flight.
